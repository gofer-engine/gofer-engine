        Gofer Engine is built on top of TypeScript. This means that you can
        write filters and transformer steps with confidence and code completion.
        Whether you are writing a simple filter or a complex transformer, Gofer
        Engine will help you catch errors before they make it to production.

        Gofer Engine can be used as a standalone interoperability engine or as
        a library in your application. As a standalone engine, Gofer Engine can
        process messages between a variety of sources and destinations. As a
        library, Gofer Engine can be used to build interoperability directly
        into your app.
