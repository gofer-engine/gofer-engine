Gofer Engine has been a fun project to build out, but it is not something I am
currently using myself at the moment.

I have recently made a job change. I am still within the Healthcare
Interoperability field, but no longer working for the same organization. My new
organization is implementing EPIC and I am now EPIC Bridges Certified (also EPIC
DC Admin Certified). We will be using InterSystems HealthShare Health Connect
interface engine. I have not yet actually started working with this interface
engine, but from what I am seeing, I will not have a need for a tool like Gofer
Engine in this organization in the foreseeable future.

Since I am not utilizing Gofer-Engine, it will be difficult to continue
developing it without someone dogfooding the product.

If you are interested in using Gofer Engine at it's earliest stages, or even if
you are available to try it out for a specific use case need that you have then
please contact me.

Thank you,

Anthony Master
