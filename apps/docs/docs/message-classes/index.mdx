Gofer Engine supports a variety of message types. Each one of these message
types begins by implementing the `IMsg` interface. This interface is defined
as follows:

<ExampleCode path="IMsg.ts" hide={[[12, 25]]} />

This interface provides the basic operations and methods to extrapolate data
from the message, transform the message, and serialize the message to the raw
format.

The specific message types may provide additional methods and properties to
further manipulate the message. The following sections will describe each
message type in detail.
