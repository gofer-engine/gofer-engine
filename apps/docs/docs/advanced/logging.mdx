# Logging

Logger is part of the `Context`. This allows you to use the logger from within
any flow that includes the `context` such as a `filter` or `transformer`.

There are 4 log levels:

- `debug` should be used for development, testing, and debugging purposes only
- `info` should be used for your information only
- `warn` should be used for warnings that should be fixed, but are not show stoppers
- `error` should be used for show-stopping errors

Log Levels are configurable per each channel. This allows some channels to log
at a higher level while others are active in production and logging with a lower
level. In the OOP style, use the `logLevel` method.

Setting the Log Level logs everything up to that level. For instance, using the
`warn` log level will log both `error` and `warn` events.

The logger is fairly simple to use as seen in this example of a filter step:

<ExampleCode path="logExample.ts" hide={[[2,14]]} />

The `logger` is by default set up to log with `console.log`. You can replace the
default logger using the global `"LOGGER"` from Gofer Engine's [Event
System](./event-system), `handelse`.

<ExampleCode path="logExample.ts" />
