# `transform` â€” Manipulate Data

Transform Flows are used to manipulate message data. 

## Interface

The interface TransformFlow can be defined as:

```ts
type TransformFunc = (msg: IMsg, context: IMessageContext) => IMsg
type TransformFlow =
  | TransformFunc
  | { kind: 'transform'; transform: TransformFunc }
```

_Refer to the [Message Interface](../message-classes/hl7#transforming) for more information on the `IMsg` exposed methods and  transforming the data in the message._

_Refer to the [Context Object](../advanced/context) for more information on the `IMessageContext` type._

The transformer functions of the class retuns back the class instance, so you can chain them together.

## Use Case

The Ingestion and Route each allow for an array of flows. The transform flow, is one of the allowed flows in either one of these arrays. If a message is transformed in an ingestion flow, then all of the latter flows in the ingestion, and all of the routes will use the newly transformed data. If a message is transformed in a route, then only the latter flows in that route will use the newly transformed data. _Routes are called **asynchronously**_, _The Ingestion flows are called **synchronously**_.

```ts
const channel: ChannelConfig = {
  // ...
  ingestion: [
    // highlight-next-line
    // transformers here
  ],
  routes: [
    {
      kind: 'route',
      name: 'Route 1',
      flows: [
        // highlight-next-line
        // transformers here
      ],
    },
    {
      kind: 'route',
      name: 'Route 2',
      flows: [
        // highlight-next-line
        // transformers here
      ],
    }
  ]
};
```

## Example

Here is an example of a transformer that takes the field PV1-3 and adds a prefix to it:

<ExampleCode path="locationPrefix.ts" numbered />

## Advanced Example

Since Gofer Engine uses native TypeScript/JavaScript, you can use any of the recipes you are familiar with to pass variables and create advanced transformer logic. You could even keep your transformers in a common directory and import them where needed into your channels.

Let's refactor the previous example a little bit and make the transformer function reusable for other paths and allowing a passed through prefix/suffix.

<ExampleCode path="addPrefix.ts" numbered />

<ExampleCode path="prefixedChannel.ts" numbered />

## Advanced Type Control


For advanced type control, you can pass through a generic to the `ChannelConfig` (the _second_ generic option) which passes down to the `FilterFlow` generic to either:

- `'F'` = Only allows raw transform functions. E.G. `ingestion: [(msg) => msg]`
- `'O'` = Only allow transforming functions in objects. E.G. `ingestion: [{ transform: (msg) => msg }]`
- `'B'` = Allow _**B**oth_ raw transform functions or wrapped in objects. E.G. `ingestion: [(msg) => msg, { transform: (msg) => msg }]`
The default is 'B'. E.G. `const conf: ChannelConfig<'B', 'B'> = ...`

### OOP Style

The OOP style channel builder transform method aligns with the following types:

```ts
IngestionClass.transform = (transform: TransformFlow<'F'>) => IngestionClass
RouteClass.transform = (transform: TransformFlow<'F>) => RouteClass
```

This means that the `transform` method accepts a single argument which is a function.
