# `transformFilter`

For added flexibility, you can pass through a `TransformOrFilterFlow` to the ingestion array or route flows. This allows you to specify a filter and/or a transformer in the same step.


## Interface

The interface TransformOrFilterFlow is defined as:

```ts
type TransformFilterFunction = (
  msg: IMsg,
  context: IMessageContext
) => false | IMsg
type TransformOrFilterFlow =
  | TransformFilterFunction
  | { kind: 'transformFilter'; transformFilter: TransformFilterFunction }
```

## Use Case

This allows you to write a flow step that can exit early if a condition is not met and return false to prevent further processing of the following transformation steps. Another benefit this flexibility affords is to be able to keep your logic in a single process instead of having to break it out between filters and transformers separate flows.

An example use case without providing a code snippet, is when you need to do a transformation step, but only if another condition is met, such as converting local identifiers to coded value sets unless they are already mapped by a previous process.

## OOP Style

<!-- TODO: implement filterOrTransform in OOP Style -->

The method `filterOrTransform` is not yet implemented for the OOP style channel builder.
