# `store` — Persist Data

Gofer Engine currently supports data stores for persisting messages,
acknowledgements, or other elements configured within the worfklows. Currently,
five storage databases/methods are supported. This provides a variety of
different type of datastores that may work for different applications. We
support an RDBMS, a Document Store, a Graph Database, and a Multi-Model
Database. Depending upon the uniformity of your data and how you want to use the
persisted data, you find some data stores work better for your use case than
others.

Stores can be used within the flow of both the ingestion and the routes of
channels in Gofer Engine. This allows storing messages before they are filtered
and/or transformed. You can also add configuration to persist acknowledgement
replies.

The `StoreConfig` type accepts one of the keys from the interface `StoreOptions`.

```ts
import { RequireExactlyOne } from 'type-fest';
import {
  postgresOpts,
  mongoOpts,
  surrealOpts,
  dgraphOpts,
  fileOpts,
} from '@gofer-engine/stores';

interface StoreOptions {
  postgres: postgresOpts;
  mongo: mongoOpts;
  surreal: surrealOpts;
  dgraph: dgraphOpts;
  file: fileOpts;
}

type StoreConfig = RequireExactlyOne<StoreOptions>;
```

## PostgreSQL

[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), often simply Postgres, is an advanced
open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). It has been proven to
be highly scalable both in the sheer quantity of data it can manage and in the
number of concurrent users it can accommodate. It offers an extensive range of
data types, robust transactional support, and a variety of extension
capabilities. Postgres is widely used in many production applications today due
to its performance, robustness, and broad SQL compliance.

Since RDBMS has a schemafull database, the messages are stored in json columns
of predefined schemad tables. On the first initialization of a postgres store,
a schema check is performed and the required schema applied if it does not
conflict with the existing schema.

The postgres configuration type extends the `PoolConfiguration` from the
`postgresql-client`. This allows developers the ability to follow an interface
they are accustom to using, and add the following options for `schemaowner`,
`table`, and `id`.

```ts
import { PoolConfiguration } from 'postgresql-client';

type postgresOpts extends PoolConfiguration {
  table?: string;
  schemaOwner?: string;
  // @depracated PostgreSQL will use an internal auto-incremented primary key
  id?: string;
}
```

- `table` - The table to use to store messages. Defaults to `"test"`
- `schemaOwner` - The location of the schema that holds the table. Defaults to
  `"postgres"`
- `id` - If `"UUID"` then a random UUID will be generated, else if matches
  pattern of HL7v2 path such as `$MSH-10.1` then the id will be selected from the
  message, else undefined. This value will be set to the `guid` column.

## MongoDB

[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) is a popular NoSQL database that provides
high performance, high availability, and easy scalability. It works on the
concept of collections and documents, using a flexible, JSON-like format called
BSON for data storage. Unlike relational databases, MongoDB's document-oriented
model makes it easy to store and process large amounts of data with diverse
structures. It's often used for building modern applications that require a
flexible, scalable database, and rapid development.

Since MongoDB uses flexible JSON-like data storage, there is no need to
predefine schemad tables. On the first initialization of a mongo store, there is
no schema check, instead a reusable connection is made to the mongo store.

The mongo configuration type provides the following options for connecting to a Mongo Store and declaring how messages are stored:

```ts
import { MongoClientOptions } from 'mongodb';

type mongoOpts {
  id?: string;
  uri?: string;
  options?: MongoClientOptions;
  database?: string;
  collection?: string;
  warnOnError?: boolean;
  normalized?: boolean;
}
```

- `id` - The source to use for each message identifier. Defaults to `UUID` and can get message pieces using for example `$MSH-10.1`
- `uri` - The mongodb uri string to use for connecting. See:
  [Connection String](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/connection-string/)
- `options` - The `MongoClientOptions` to use in the connection. See [Mongo
  Connection
  Options](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/node/current/fundamentals/connection/connection-options/)
- `database` - The database to use to store messages.
- `collection` - The collection to use to store messages.
- `warnOnError` - If true, log warnings instead of throwing errors.
- `normalized` - If true, the JSON document will be normalized for easier
  comparing between documents. If false, a minified JSON document will be stored
  providing for smaller size records.

## SurrealDB

[SurrealDB](https://surrealdb.com/) is a distributed, multi-model database
system designed for cloud-native applications. It supports various data models
including document, graph, and key-value stores, making it versatile for
different types of applications. SurrealDB is built to handle large-scale data
across many commodity servers, providing high availability and easy scalability.
Its distributed nature and multi-model support make it a suitable choice for
applications that require a flexible, robust, and scalable database solution.

Since SurrealDB is a flexible multi-model storage, there is no need to
predefine schemad tables. On the first initialization of a surreal store, there is
no schema check, instead a reusable connection is made to the surreal database store.

The surreal configuration type provides the following options for connecting to a Surreal Database and declaring how messages are stored:

```ts
type surrealOpts {
  id?: string;
  uri?: string;
  pass?: string;
  warnOnError?: boolean;
  namespace?: string;
  database?: string;
  table?: string;
  normalized?: boolean;
}
```

- `id` - The source to use for each message identifier. Defaults to `UUID` and
  can get message pieces using for example `$MSH-10.1`
- `uri` - The rpc endpoint to your SurrealDB database. Example:
  `"http://127.0.0.1:8000/rpc"`
- `user` - The username to use for authentication to the database.
- `pass` - The password to use for authentication to the database.
- `warnOnError` - If true, log warnings instead of throwing errors.
- `namespace` - The namespace within SurrealDB to use. Defaults to `"test"`.
- `database` - The database to use to store messages. Defaults to `"test"`.
- `table` - The table to use to store messages. Defaults to `"test"`
- `normalized` - If true, the JSON document will be normalized for easier
  comparing between documents. If false, a minified JSON document will be stored
  providing for smaller size records.

## DgraphDB

[Dgraph](https://dgraph.io/) is an open-source, distributed graph database,
built for production environments, and written entirely in Go. Dgraph is
designed to be a high-performance database that scales seamlessly, providing
ACID transactions, consistent replication, and linearizable reads. It's
optimized for fast, efficient retrieval of complex query patterns, making it
suitable for powering real-time applications. Its graph model is flexible and
easy to work with, allowing for intuitive data modeling and interaction.

Dgraph doesn't support JSON fields, and there are limitations on data structure when using it's type system, so for these reasons, Gofer Engine only supports Dgraph for storing and retrieving HL7 v2 message types at this time.

```ts
type dgraphOpts {
  id?: string;
  uri?: string;
  warnOnError?: boolean;
}
```

- `id` - The source to use for each message identifier. Defaults to `UUID` and
  can get message pieces using for example `$MSH-10.1`
- `uri` - uri including port to gRPC of alpha node. Defaults to:
  `"172.0.0.1:9080"`. See [Dgraph Port Usage](https://dgraph.io/docs/deploy/security/ports-usage/)
- `warnOnError` - If true, log warnings instead of throwing errors.

## OS File System

File System ([fs](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html)) storage refers to the use of a computer's file system to store and
manage data. This method of storage involves writing data directly to a
system's hard drive or other storage device. It's a simple and straightforward
method of data storage, often used for local applications or for applications
that don't require the complex features provided by databases. File System
storage allows for direct control over files and directories, making it a
flexible option for many different types of applications.

```ts
type fileOpts {
  path?: string[]
  format?: 'string' | 'json'
  overwrite?: boolean
  append?: boolean
  autoCreateDir?: boolean
  warnOnError?: boolean
  extension?: string
  filename?: string | string[]
  verbose?: boolean
  /**
    * @depracated Not used in file store, use filename instead
    */ 
  id?: string
}
```


- `path` - Defaults to `"['local']"`
- `format` - Ddefaults to `"string"`
- `overwrite` - Default to `true`
- `append` - Defaults to `false`
- `autoCreateDir` - Defaults to `true`
- `warnOnError` - If true, log warnings instead of throwing errors. Defaults to `false`
- `extension` - Defaults to `".hl7"`
- `filename` - Defaults to `"$MSH-10.1"`
- `verbose` - Defaults to `false`
- ~~`id`~~ - Not used in file store, use filename instead

The `path` and `filename` settings can be an array of strings that get
concatenated together. Paths are concatenated using the directory traverse
character (`/`). Filenames are concatenating with no separating characters. If you
need a separating character, then you can add it as an element in the array.


## Adding New Stores

Gofer Engine is open to implementing additional storage solutions. To implement
a new store, a new class should be created implementing the `IStoreClass`
interface.

### Interface

Each of the store classes must implement the base `IStoreClass` providing three
main methods.

```ts
interface IStoreClass {
  store: StoreFunc;
  close: () => Promise<void>;
  query: (query: string) => Promise<unknown>;
}
type StoreFunc = (data: IMsg, context: IMessageContext) => Promise<boolean>;
```

- `store` - The main method used by the implementation to take a message and
  persists it into the store. A boolean must be returned indicating if the
  message was stored (returns `true`) or if the message was not stored (return
  `false`)

- `close` - The method used to close the connection to the database when the
  channel is being stopped.

- `query` - The method used to query a stored message. This is currently used
  for building tests but in the future may be used to query messages from the
  store on scheduled jobs.

## Future Changes

All of the stores are currently in a single npm library, `@gofer-engine/stores`.
In the future, we will most likely break each store into it’s own library and
require users to install only the stores that they need to use to reduce unused
code in project builds.
