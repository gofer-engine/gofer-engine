# Integration Tutorial

If you're building a Node.JS application like Next.JS or a GraphQL Server and
need to integrate directly with HL7 interfaces, we've included messengers to
make creating and sending HL7 simple once and for all.

## Setup

To integrate Gofer Engine into an existing application, it seems silly to say,
but you will need an existing application. Perhaps you are researching before
building a new application or extending functionality of an existing one. Either
way, this short tutorial purposely doesn't cover the setup of an existing
project. But it does require that the project is a Node.JS environment, and you
have access to the npm repository.

Another point to clarify is that integrating messenger services into your
application should be implemented on the **server side**.

_For example, in your Next.JS application, the messenger should be implemented
in an API Page or Server Side function and not in a front-end page directly._

## Install

Within your project, run:

```bash
npm i @gofer-engine/engine @gofer-engine/hl7 @gofer-engine/tools
```

Alternatively, use your package manager of choice and follow its syntax for
adding new packages from the npm repository.

You may need additional/fewer packages from `@gofer-engine/` depending on what
functionality you need.

## Create a Messenger

The `gofer` class exposes a method called `messenger` that accepts a
`MessengerRoute` function. This method returns a tuple that contains the
messenger callback and an id to identify the messenger class to observe events
or control later in your application.

The `MessengerRoute` function follows the below _simplified_ type. Also including the _simplified_ `ORoute` interface for quick reference.

```ts title="@gofer-engine/engine/src/types.ts"
// highlight-next-line
type MessengerRoute = (R: ORoute) => ORoute;

export interface ORoute extends OBase<ORoute> {
  name: (name: string) => ORoute;
  id: (id: string | number) => ORoute;
  filter: (f: FilterFunc) => ORoute;
  transform: (t: TransformFunc) => ORoute;
  store: (s: StoreConfig) => ORoute;
  setVar: (scope: varTypes, varName: string, varValue: MsgVar) => ORoute;
  getVar: (scope: varTypes, varName: string, getVal: WithVarDo) => ORoute;
  setMsgVar: (varName: string, varValue: MsgVar) => ORoute;
  getMsgVar: (varName: string, getVal: WithVarDo) => ORoute;
  setChannelVar: (varName: string, varValue: MsgVar) => ORoute;
  getChannelVar: (varName: string, getVal: WithVarDo) => ORoute;
  setGlobalVar: (varName: string, varValue: MsgVar) => ORoute;
  getGlobalVar: (varName: string, getVal: WithVarDo) => ORoute;
  setRouteVar: (varName: string, varValue: MsgVar) => ORoute;
  getRouteVar: (varName: string, getVal: WithVarDo) => ORoute;
  send(method: 'tcp', host: FunctProp<string>, port: FunctProp<number>): ORoute;
  send(method: 'http', options: IHTTPConfig<true>): ORoute;
  send(method: 'https', options: IHTTPSConfig<true>): ORoute;
}
```

For this tutorial, we will just use a single flow in the route to send to a tcp
HL7 listener. The full example will show that the `host` and `port` options can
come from the environment variables.

<ExampleCode
  preappendPath="function/"
  path="sample-messenger-function.ts"
  start={1}
  end={10}
  hide={[[2, 6]]}
  metastring="{3-5}"
/>

## Use the Callback

The messenger callback function accepts a function that is run to build the
message to send to the route defined in the previous steps. This inline function
is expected to return any one of the classes that implement the `IMsg`
interface.

In this example, we will be using the `HL7v2Msg` class.

<ExampleCode
  preappendPath="function/"
  path="sample-messenger-function.ts"
  start={2}
  end={33}
  hide={[
    [2,16,'\n// ...\n'],
    [3, 3, '  messenger((msg: HL7v2Msg) => {']
  ]}
/>

Alternatively, we could create and return a new instance of the `HL7v2Msg` class
instead of using the argument of this callback function, which provides the
interface `IMsg`. We asserted that `msg` is the `HL7v2Msg` _default_ class. If
we did not need custom methods such as the `addSegment` method, then we would
not need to assert the class and could use any of the interface methods exposed
by every message type class.

## Full Example

Here is the full detailed example of using Gofer Engine to send `ADT_A20`
messages within a Next.JS API page.

<ExampleCode preappendPath="function/" path="sample-messenger-function.ts" />

<ExampleCode
  preappendPath="pages/api/"
  path="sample-next-api-page.ts"
  start={2}
/>
