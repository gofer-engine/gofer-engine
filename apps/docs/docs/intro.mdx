# Standalone Tutorial

_**This tutorial is geared towards building a standalone interface engine. For
those looking to integrate Gofer Engine into an existing application, the
[Integration Tutorial](./integration) might be more suitable.**_

Providing a step-by-step guide is invaluable for newer developers. If you're
already well-versed in Node projects, feel free to skip to the
[Installation](#install-gofer-engine) section.

## Setup the Environment

Ensure you're using the latest Node.js version; download it
[here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

1. Create a new project directory for your Node application.
2. Open a terminal/command prompt in your project folder.
3. Initiate a new node project by running `npm init` and follow the prompts.

While not mandatory, it's recommended to have the following packages installed:

- **TypeScript:** A superset of JavaScript. Install with: `npm install -D
  typescript`
- **nodemon:** Monitors changes in your source and restarts your server. Install
  with: `npm install -D nodemon`
- **ts-node:** Allows running TypeScript files directly without compiling.
  Install with: `npm install -D ts-node`

If using TypeScript (optional but recommended), create a `tsconfig.json` file in
your project’s root directory. Use the following as a starting point:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2015",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "strict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "outDir": "out",
    "sourceMap": true,
    "rootDir": "src"
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*"]
}
```

:::tip

Noteworthy: If you're not already using the VS-Code IDE, we highly recommend
it!

## Install Gofer Engine

1. Open a terminal in your project folder.
2. Run `npm install @gofer-engine/engine` to install the Gofer Engine
   dependency.

## Usage

1. Create a new directory called `src` in your project’s root.
2. Create a `server.ts` file in your project’s `src` folder.
3. Add the following code to `server.ts`:

<ExampleCode path="server.ts" numbered />

Alternatively, use a configuration object:

<ExampleCode path="serverConfig.ts" numbered />

These examples add a single channel listening on `localhost` port `5500` via
`tcp` for HL7 v2.x messages. It replies with an acknowledgment message and
writes the message to a file in the default `./local` directory.

Refer to [Developing Interface Channels in OOP style](#) or [Developing
Interface Channels with Config Files](#) for more information on building and
configuring channels.

## Running in Development

1. Add a script to your `package.json` file:

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "nodemon src/server.ts"
}
```

2. Run `npm run dev` to start the server.

:::tip

By using nodemon, changes to your project files will trigger server restarts.

## Version Control with Git

Gofer Engine allows easy version control of your channels by checking your Node
project into a Git repository. Branch and merge changes effortlessly for
development and testing.

- [jest](https://jestjs.io/): A delightful JavaScript (and TypeScript) Testing
Framework with a focus on simplicity.
- [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/): A utility to simplify modern
native git hooks. For more CI/CD resources, check out these [38 Best CI/CD Tools

If you're in an on-premise-only environment, consider Bonobo Git Server as an
alternative to GitHub.

## Preparing for Production

Add a build and start script to your package.json file:

```json
"scripts": {
  "build": "npx tsc",
  "start": "node out/server.js"
}
```

## Deploying to Production

The workflow below uses a Git repository. Alternatively, you can deploy to
production using other methods.

On your production server, run `git clone <your-project-repo>` to clone your
repository.

Run `npm install && run build && npm start` to install dependencies, build, and
start the server.

For Windows environments, use [this setup
guide](https://www.helpmegeek.com/run-nodejs-application-as-windows-service/) to
run the node server as a Windows Service.

For Linux environments, follow [this setup
guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-node-js-application-for-production-on-ubuntu-18-04)
to run the server.

Consider using Docker with a docker-compose file for cloning the repository,
installing dependencies, building the project, and starting the server in a
container. While outside the current scope, reach out if you need assistance or
want to contribute.
